# alx-files_manager
This project is a summary of this back-end trimester: authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination and background processing.

The objective is to build a simple platform to upload and view files:

* User authentication via a token
* List all files
* Upload a new file
* Change permission of a file
* View a file
* Generate thumbnails for images

You will be guided step by step for building it, but you have some freedoms of implementation, split in more files etc‚Ä¶ (`utils` folder will be your friend)

Of course, this kind of service already exists in the real life - it‚Äôs a learning purpose to assemble each piece and build a full product.

Enjoy!
